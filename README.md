# fake_or_real_jupyter
Hello !
To compare machine learning techniques SVM,kNN,RandomForest,NaiveBayes etc,.
i used data about that facebook's accounts are real or fake?
I get data from "Kaggle.com" and analyzed  about accounts look as a real but really not. 
I stored the data separately as test data and train data, didn't put data irrelevant variables.
